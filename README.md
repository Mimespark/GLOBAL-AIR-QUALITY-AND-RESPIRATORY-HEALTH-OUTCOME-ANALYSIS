**ABOUT THE DATASET**

This dataset provides a comprehensive, multi-city view of daily air quality metrics and corresponding respiratory-related hospital admissions. it enables robust exploration of the relationship between urban air pollution and health outcomes.

**DATASET VARAIABLES**

Air quality index (AQI), Particulate matter (PM2.5), Particulate matter (PM10), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), Ozone (O₃), Temperature, Humidity, Population Density, hospital capacity, and daily respiratory hospital admissions
Cities Covered: Delhi, Beijing, Mexico City, Los Angeles, London, Tokyo, Cairo, São Paulo

**ANALYSIS OBJECTIVE**

To analyze the global air quality and respiratory health outcomes across different cities exploring key air pollution metrics such as Air Quality Index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and ozone (O₃) concentrations.

**KEY AIR POLLUTION METRIC**

AQI (Air Quality Index): A composite index that translates multiple air pollutant like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, and O₃, making it easier to understand overall air quality.
PM2.5 (Particulate Matter ≤ 2.5 µm): Fine inhalable particles that are invisible to the naked eye. From sources like Vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, wildfires, burning fuels.
PM10 (Particulate Matter ≤ 10 µm): Coarser particles than PM2.5 — includes dust, pollen, mold, and ash. From sources like Construction sites, roads, agriculture, mining, natural dust storms
NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide): A toxic gas and a major traffic-related pollutant
O₃ (Ozone): A gas formed when sunlight reacts with air pollutants like NO₂ and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) — often worse in sunny cities.

**POTENTIAL ANALYIS**

Comparing AQI and PM2.5 levels in different countries

Analyzing hospital admission or death rates due to air pollution

Mapping regions with both poor air and high lung disease rates

Average Monthly Temperature Across Cities

AQI Comparison Across Selected Countries

Compare humidity with temperature

Average Nitrogen Dioxide Levels by Cities

Comparing AQI and PM10 levels in different countries

Comparing AQI and PM2.5 levels in different countries

**IN-ANALYSIS INSIGHTS**

Countries with the highest PM2.5 levels tend to have poorer overall air quality (higher AQI), indicating that fine particulate pollution is a major contributor to unhealthy air in those regions.

Regions with higher PM2.5, PM10, or NO₂ concentrations report more respiratory-related hospitalizations or death.

Cities like Beijing and Delhi show a concerning overlap between severe air pollution

Warmer months correlate with spikes in ozone (O₃) levels, which may aggravate seasonal breathing problems — especially in sunny cities like Los Angeles or Mexico City.

Countries with rapid urbanization and industrial activity tend to have consistently higher AQI, while countries with green policies or lower population density show better air quality.

In some cities, high humidity combined with high temperature amplifies discomfort and may worsen airborne pollutant effects, creating a hazardous climate-health combo.

Cities with dense traffic networks and fewer emission regulations show elevated NO₂ levels, especially during peak commuting hours, posing a chronic respiratory risk.

Some countries with high AQI also show high PM10 levels,

PM2.5 has a stronger correlation with AQI spikes than PM10 in many countries, highlighting the fine, invisible particles as the more dangerous pollutant.

Air Quality Index and Particulate Matter (PM10 & PM2.5);

Delhi and Beijing show the highest AQI levels, which indicating very poor air quality.

PM10 levels are highest in Beijing (144) and Delhi (133), confirming a severe concentration of coarse air pollutant in these regions.

London and Tokyo have lower AQI and PM values respectively, indicating better air quality in these cities.

**OBJECTIVES**

**Maximum Coarse Air (PM10)**

Beijing, Delhi, and Mexico City have the worst PM10 concentrations, with levels exceeding 125 µg/m³.
São Paulo and Cairo show relatively lower max PM10.
Hospital Capacity vs Population Density

Delhi and Beijing have the highest population density, yet their hospital capacity unit is visibly low.
Cairo and São Paulo also display low hospital capacity compared to their population density.
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) by Cities

Cairo, Los Angeles, and Mexico City have the highest NO₂ levels (71 µg/m³), highlighting heavy omission from vehicles.
São Paulo and Delhi have comparatively lower levels but still above WHO’s recommended thresholds.
Ozone (O₃) Levels by cities

Delhi (94) and Beijing (90) have the highest ozone concentrations, typically worsened by sunlight.

**Humidity and Temperature**

Humidity remains relatively stable, fluctuating around 56.5% to 57.3%, with June (57.18%) and January (57.3%) slightly peaking.
Cairo is the warmest city with an average temperature of 17.7°C, while London is the coolest at 17.3°C
Hospital Admission by City

Hospital admissions (visualized geographically) seem higher in cities with poor AQI and PM values, particularly Delhi, Beijing, Mexico city, Los Angelais, London, Tokyo and relatively low in cities like Cairo and Sao Paulo

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Focus air regulatory efforts on Delhi, Beijing, and Cairo, which consistently rank worst in AQI, PM10, PM2.5, O₃, and NO₂.

Increase hospital capacity, especially in overly populated areas like Delhi, São Paulo, and Cairo, where infrastructure lags behind environmental needs.

Implement low-emission zones, electric public vehicles, and vehicle emission monitoring in Los Angeles, Mexico City, and Cairo to reduce Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) levels.

Launch air-quality awareness in high-risk zones, especially where Air quality index (AQI) is persistent high, focusing on protective behavior like noise mask use.

Encourage cities to support citizens with real-time pollution apps and health risk alerts, particularly in cities with high Coarse air and Ozone (O₃) Volatility.
